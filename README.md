Mobile first design (Desktop to Mobile viewing)
1. CSS BEM Model (Styled efficiently for future developers)
2. Initial Wireframe mockup
3. Grid system (Basic visual guidelines)
4. HTML5 (Optimized for the web)
5. ES Linted JS (Clean and modernized javascript for interactions)
6. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
7. Minimize assets (Faster page loads and save bandwidth)
8. Regression testing (Add tests to each page module)
9. Browser compatibility (Make sure your visitors from Chrome to Safari all see the page you want them to see)
10. Google Analytics Setup (Good for statistical inferences)


The services that are negotiable are the following:
Speed of development (Seems you're flexible here so we can factor that in to the cost)
Size of development
Special feature requests - Any custom needs in animations/interactions etc.
CMS - A customized platform for you to change things by yourself with a log in.
Having me take care of the hosting for you.
Specific development language: React, Angular, PHP, plain html, etc.
